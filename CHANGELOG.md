 # v 1.2.0 / 6.1.2018
  * "build-express-api build-schema" now allows multiple controller and model creation. A schema must be defined in beaConfig.json. This feature was suggested by https://github.com/FrancescoSaverioZuppichini. Please see documentation for more.
 * Fixed mini bugs, and improved error messages.
 
 # v 1.1.0 / 30.12.2017
  * "build-express-api init" now creates beaConfig.json, which contains the paths to the controllers,models and server file, so the user is not limited to the ./rest folder
  * New action added "create-config" that only creates beaConfig.json , without ./rest folder

# v 1.0.9 / 2.12.2017
  * First production ready version
